# 1.5 Casting and Ranges of Variables
# Video 1
Casting allows us to temporarily change a variable to another type for an expression
You can put the name of a data type in parenthesis before a number ("(double) 6", for example) to temporarily convert it to that data type
You can round a double by adding 0.5 and then converting it to an int ("(int) 11.6 + 0.5" returns 12, for example)

Storing an integer above or below a certain limits (2147483647 and -2147483648) causes an overflow error when compiling
Trying to print a value above or below these values will cause them to roll over and can cause odd bugs
