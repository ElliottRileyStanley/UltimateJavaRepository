# Text Similarity

<<<<<<< HEAD
In this assignment we will explore the Apache Commons Text library to measure the similarity between two pieces of text.

There are many ways to measure how similar two pieces of text are. In this assignment we will explore two algorithms: the [Levenshtein distance](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-text/apidocs/org/apache/commons/text/similarity/LevenshteinDistance.html) and the [Fuzzy score](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-text/apidocs/org/apache/commons/text/similarity/FuzzyScore.html).
=======
There are many ways to measure how similar two pieces of text are. In this assignment we will explore two algorithms: the Levenshtein distance and the Fuzzy score. We will use the Apache Commons Text library to do this.

The `Utils.java` is a place to store any code (as static methods) that you want to re-use between the different parts of the assignments.

## Getting used to the library
>>>>>>> 66edaeaecb14c01d5cd77ea8a7dd91e7073da53a

1. `GettingStarted.java`

   Write a program that uses `Scanner` and asks the use to type in two words. It should then display the Fuzzy score between those two words, and the Levenshtein distance between those two words.

   For example:

   ```
   Please enter your first word:
   participate
   Please enter your second word:
   articulate
   The Fuzzy Score between 'participate' and 'articulate' is: 13
   The Levenshtein Distance between 'participate' and 'articulate' is: 3
   ```

2. `UsingDictionary.java`

   Write a program that uses `Scanner` and asks the user to type in a word. It should calculate the Fuzzy score and LevenshteinDistance between each word in an English dictionary (which you can load using the `getEnglishWords` method provided) and the word itself. Display the best fuzzy score match, and the best Levenshtein distance match.

   For example:

   ```
   Please enter your word:
   edep
   Closest word using fuzzy algorithm was: depart
   Closest word using Levenshtein algorithm was: adept
   ```

3. `ChooseFont.java`

   _Note: the `Utils.java` file is a place to store any code (as static methods) that you want to re-use between the different parts of the assignment_

   You can get an array of all the fonts available to Java's graphics environment using:

   ```java
   String[] allFonts = GraphicsEnvironment.getLocalGraphicsEnvironment().getAvailableFontFamilyNames();
   ```

   Display all the fonts available to the user, and ask them to type a font name. They shouldn't have to spell the font name perfectly with matching spaces and case etc. Based on what they typed in, show them the top 3 fonts that match the text they typed in.

   For example:

   ```
