# 1.2 Variables and Data Types
## Video 1
Data can be boolean (true or false), an integer or int (a whole number), a double (decimals/floating point numbers), and strings (text, enclosed in double quotes)
Primitive types are built in to Java, and cannot use methods to perform actions
Non-primitive types are not built in to Java and are made by the programmer (with the exception of string), and can use methods to perform actions

Names of variables cannot start with digits, and cannot include spaces, special characters, or Java reserved words
Camel case is commonly used when naming multi-word variables, where the first word starts with a lower case and all others start with upper case
You can declare a variable in Java by saying the data type and then the name of the variable ("int total;" for example)
You can make a constant, non-changing variable by putting the word final before declaring a variable ("final int total;" for example)
Final variables are put in all caps, not camelcase
