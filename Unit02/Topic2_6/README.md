# 2.6 String Objects - Concatenation, Literals, and More
# Video 1
Strings objects can be created by using string literals or a constructor.
Strings are immutable, meaning they can’t be changed.
# Video 2
Strings can be put together with the “+” operator.
“+” will join, and “+=” will join and also define.
You can join strings and integers with concatenation.

Escape sequences can be used to create special characters you couldn’t get before.
“\n” returns a new line, “\\” returns a backslash, and “\”” returns a quote.
