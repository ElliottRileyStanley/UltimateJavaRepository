# 2.9 Using the Math Class
# Video 1
Math classes return numeric values that act upon given parameters.
Static methods belong to a class instead of an object of the class.
The Math class is part of the java.lang.Math package.
Math.abs can either return the absolute value of an integer or double.
Math.pow returns the first double raised to the power of the second double.
Math.sqrt returns the double value raised to the power of 2.
Math.random returns a random double from 0 to 1.

You can use Math.random to get any range of random numbers by adding the low range, and then multiplying by the difference of the high range to the low range plus 1, and then casting as an int.
