# 2.1 Objects - Instances of Classes
# Video 1
An object is an instance of a class, a class is a type of blueprint, and variables are used to name objects. (“Robot” is an example of a class, and you can then define a new robot to a variable to use it to make silly little things).
Attributes are things that can change about the class to make an object.
You can define an object with 2 variables that will then change together.
