# 1.3 Expressions and Assignment Statements
# Video 1
Adding integers results in addition, but adding strings results in the strings being concatenated
The main arithmetic operators are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%)
When using arithmetic operations with the same 2 data types, the result is that data type (int/int=int, for example)
When using arithmetic operations with different data types, the result is the bigger data type (double*int=double)

In compound expressions (3*2+1, for example), multiplication, division, and modulus are performed left to right first, and then the same is done with addition and subtraction
If an expression is in parenthesis, it is done first
You can assign a variable with an equals sign after the variable name ("int x = 2;", for example)
Diving by 0 return an arithmetic exception

An equal sign makes the variable on the left equal the value on the right
The assignment operator is the last thing that runs in the order of operations
